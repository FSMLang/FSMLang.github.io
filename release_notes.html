        <p>New C language output variant creating an event-oriented array is provided.
        </p>

        <p>Most full tests now create each variant (event-state table, state array, and, event array).  In order to
        create identical output with each, "noAction" debug print statements have been added to the state and event array variants
        to match the those which were already present in the event-state table variant.
        </p>

        <p>The full tests which test all variants also have a <i>size</i> target producing a file of that name, containing the
        size of the image created by each variant.  New make include files, <i>variants.mk</i> and <i>create_target.mk</i>
        support the variant related targets.

   <td>adds a new command line option, -c, which will create a more compact event/state table.  The option is
   currently only meaningful when -tc is used with machines having actions which return events.
 
   <p>Compaction is achieved by creating a table of pointers to the action functions along with an enum to index it.  This enum
   and the state enum are used to create the event/state table basic type; and, the enums are declared with the packed
   attribute.  Thus, for machines having less than 256 actions and states, the size of the basic event/state table type struct
   is only 2 bytes.

      next state.  This type of machine uses no memory, as there is no event/state table; the machine is
      purely code.

      <li>transitions may now be done through functions, rather than designated states.  As with actions, these
        are not previously declared; they are simply stated.  The function arguments are first a pointer to the
        machine, followed by the event causing the transition.
        </li>
      <li>both actions and transitions may be given return declarations.  These are in the form of "name returns ...;"
        where "name" is a previously seen action or transition function name.  Presently, this information is used
