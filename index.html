<p>FSMLang is designed to allow design work in the problem space of finite 
state machines without the encumbrances of any particular implementation 
language. Thus, FSMLang is implemented as a "pre-processor," generating 
code in any desired general programming language to implement the described 
finite state machine. FSMLang allows effort to be focused on the definition 
of events, states, and transitions; indeed, though the action to be taken 
in any particular event/state intersection is declarable (of course), the 
actual definition of that action is treated as a detail which falls outside 
the scope of FSMLang.  Moreover, the mechanisms for collecting or 
determining events are also outside the language scope.  FSMLang creates an 
object or objects in a target programming language which, when inserted 
into the larger program structure will invoke the correct actions and make 
the correct transitions for the events handed it.
</p>

<p>(Though it is said, "any desired general programming language," implementation of 
FSMLang output in languages other than C is an exercise currently left to 
the reader.)
</p>

<h3 id="Simple">Example: Simple State Machine</h3>
<a href="#Philosophy">Back to Philosophy</a>

<p>As an example, consider a simple communications protocol which specifies 
that an acknowledgement must be received for each message before another 
may be sent.  The sender of messages in such a protocol must have at least 
two states: In the first state, which will be called IDLE, the sender has 
sent no message.  In the second, which will be called AWAITING_ACK, the 
sender has sent a message and is awaiting an acknowledgement. The events 
which this automaton will see are SEND_MESSAGE, the request by a client 
entity for a message to be sent, and ACK, the receipt of the acknowledgment 
from the peer automaton.
</p>

<p>The valid actions, then, are to send a message if one is requested, and the 
automaton is in the IDLE state,and to simply return to the IDLE state if an 
ACK is received while in the AWAITING_ACK state.  Sending a message 
requires a transition to the AWAITING_ACK state. The receipt of an 
acknowledgement while in the IDLE state represents a protocol error which 
may be safely ignored.  A request to send a message while in the AWAITING_
ACK state, however, must result in the message being queued for later transmission.
</p>

<p>Using FSMLang, this machine can be described this way:
</p>

<code>
/**
   This machine manages communications using a "stop and wait" protocol.
      Only one message is allowed to be outstanding.
*/
<span class="keyword">machine</span> simpleCommunicator
{

  <span class="keyword">state</span> IDLE,
        AWAITING_ACK;

  <span class="keyword">event</span> SEND_MESSAGE,
        ACK;

  /**
   Transmit message to the peer.
  */
  <span class="keyword">action</span> sendMessage[SEND_MESSAGE,IDLE] <span class="keyword">transition</span> AWAITING_ACK;

  /**
   Place message into queue.
  */
  <span class="keyword">action</span> queueMessage[SEND_MESSAGE,AWAITING_ACK];

  /**
   Check queue for messages; if found pop from queue and return SEND_MESSAGE.
   If no message is found in the queue return noEvent.
  */
  <span class="keyword">action</span> checkQueue[ACK,AWAITING_ACK] <span class="keyword">transition</span> IDLE;

  /* these lines are informational; they affect the html output,
      but do not affect any code generated.
  */
  queueMessage <span class="keyword">returns</span> noEvent;
  sendMessage  <span class="keyword">returns</span> noEvent;
  checkQueue   <span class="keyword">returns</span> SEND_MESSAGE, noEvent;

}
</code>

<p>(When no transition is specified, the machine remains in the state it was 
in when the event occured.  And, a comma seperated list of events or states 
enclosed within parentheses may be used in place of any single event or 
state designation; in which case, the action specifed will be taken in the 
"cross product" of the two (event and/or state) vectors so described.)
</p>

<iframe src="simpleCommunicator.h.html"></iframe>

<h4>This is the source file created</h4>
<iframe src="simpleCommunicator.c.html"></iframe>

<h4>This is the HTML created</h4>
<iframe src="simpleCommunicator.html"></iframe>

<p>By default, action functions return events, and the main state macine function loops until an action
indicates that there are no further events. 
</p>

<p>The action functions themselves are not generated; instead, they are written by the machine implementor. This allows FSMLang
to remain focused on the state machine, rather than the details of the implementation of its purpose for existing.
</p>

<h3 id="Hierarchical">Hierarchical</h3>
<a href="#Philosophy">Back to Philosophy</a>

<p>A more complex example shows how FSMLang treats hierarchical state machines. We reuse the <i>Simple 
Communicator</i> from the first example, but add the requirement to establish a session with the peer before any
message is sent.  One way to do this is to have a top-level state machine with two sub state machines: One machine to
establish the session; the other to send the messages, again with the requirement that only one message can be in transit
at any time.
</p>

<p>The fsm code describes the machines in this way.  Note the similarity of the <i>sendMessage</i> sub machine to the
<i>simpleCommunicator</i>, above.
</p>

<code>
/**
   <p>This machine manages communications using a "stop and wait" protocol.
      Only one message is allowed to be outstanding.
	 </p>

	 <p>Before any message can be exchanged, however, a session must be established
      with the peer.  Establishing a connection requires several exchanges to
      authenticate.  The connection will remain active as long as messages
      continue to be exchanged with a minimum frequency.
   </p>

<p>FSMLang produces one header/source file pair, or one html file for each machine it encounters.  The top-level machine's
event enumeration contains the events of all machines so that any event can be passed to the machine.  Each sub-machine has
its own enumeration, but these enumerations do not start at 0.  Rather, they are arranged so that each <i>noEvent</i> event
has the same numeric value as the corresponding event in the top-level enumeration.  In this way, sub-machines are easily
selected based on their numeric event range.
</p>

<p>The FSM function of a sub-machine returns a top-level machine event, providing the mechanism by which the sub-machines
communicate with the top-level machine.  The return value of the sub-machine FSM function is the event returned by a
sub-machine action function when that event is not a sub-machine event.  When the sub-machine action returns the
sub-machine's <i>noEvent</i> that event is translated into the top-level machine's <i>noEvent</i>.
</p>

<p>FSMLang does not provide for sub-machines to indicate that their action functions return an event from another sub-machine.
Rather, sub-machine actions can return events from their own machine, or from their parent. This is by design.
The top-level machine should provide actions when necessary to bridge between the activation of different sub-machines.
</p>

<p>However, it is possible for a sub-machine to designate any event as being "from the parent" 
(<span class="keyword"></span>event parent::</span>e1, for example).  The name, of course, must be that of an event actually
declared in the parent.  Moreover, by also giving the name of a data translation function
(<i>e.g.</i> <span class="keyword">event parent::</span>e1 <span class="keyword">data translator</span> dt1)  When this is done,
FSMLang generates code for the parent to call the submachine when that event occurs.  If a data translator is given, it will be
called before the sub-machine is invoked.  More than one sub-machine can share a parent event; the machines will be called in order.
The loop will be exited when a machine returns anything other than <span class="keyword">noEvent</span>, so that the parent can
then handle that event.
</p>

<p>It is possible, that the parent would want to inhibit the operation of the sub-machines.  <span class="keyword">state</span> s1
<span class="keyword">inhibits submachines</span> will do just that; no submachines will be run, unless shared events exist and the
parent handles those events in that state.</p>

<p>The html file created for the top-level machine contains a list of sub-machines.  The list is hyper-linked to the html
file for the respective machine.
</p>

<p>At the moment, only one level of sub-machine is supported.  This limitation may be removed in later releases.
</p>

<p>The -ts flag should always be used to generate code due the way the event enumerations are generated for sub-machines.  This limination,
too, may be removed in later releases.</p>

<p>Note that the -tp option was used to create PlantUML output, which was then processed by <a href="https://plantuml.com/guide">plantuml</a> to produce an SVG image. The html
was created using the --include-svg-img=true option to include the image in the output.
</p>

<p>An unrealized goal of the FSMLang effort is to optimize the output machine for speed and size based on an analysis of the event-state
matrix.  There are command-line switches which force the creation of a compact table, or the use of switch statements instead of a
table, but these are manual.  One should be able to make those desicions based on the density of the event-state matrix.  It may also
be possible, using matrix transformations to make some part of the matrix very dense, then use a hybrid table/switch approach in the
code.
</p>

<h3 id="StateEntryAndExitFunctions">State Entry and Exit Functions</h3>
<a href="#Philosophy">Back to Philosophy</a>
<p>Entry and exit functions may be attached to states.  For example:
<code>
<span class="keyword">state</span> some_state <span class="keyword">on entry</span> prepare_some_state;
</code>
Adds a named entry function to <i>some_state</i>.
</p>

<p>Similarly,
<code>
<span class="keyword">state</span> some_state <span class="keyword">on exit</span> tidy_up_some_state;
</code>
Adds <i>tidy_up_some_state</i> as a named exit function to <i>some_state</i>
</p>

<p>When entry or exit functions exist, code will be generated to call them appropriately.  Names given in the .fsm 
file are prepended with the name of the machine.  "Anonymous" entry or exit functions can be declared simply by
ommiting the names.  In this case names will be generated using the pattern &lt;machine_name&gt;_onEntryTo_&lt;state_name;&gt;
for entry functions, and similarly, using <i>onExitFrom</i> for exit functions.  When weak function generation is not
disabled, weak versions of these anonymous functions are created.
</p>

<p>Because they are powerful, entry and exit functions can be mis-used.  As the names chosen here suggest, they
should be used only to prepare a state or to leave it in a tidy state.  They should not be used as a substitue for
the creation of sub-machines, or well-thought out action sequences.

<p>Four targets are provided to support Linux (RH 6.5 has been tested, but may now need some maintenance),
Cygwin (on Windows 10), and, Maingw and Mingwsa (also on Windows 10).  <i>Mingw</i> uses the mingw compiler, but expects to
be built in a Cygwin shell, while Mingwsa works for a stand-alone MinGW installation (but, use the bash shell to do the build).
To make the executable for any of these, simply type <i>make &lt;target&gt;</i>, spelling the name of the target as given in the
previous sentence.  Appending ".test" to any target name will execute the full test suite.  Appending ".clean" will do as expected.

<h2 id="Basic Language Syntax">Basic Language Syntax</h2>
<a href="#TOC">Back to TOC</a>

<p>
The example machine above illustrates the major language features and 
syntax.  There are five basic keywords: <span class="keyword">machine</span>, <span class="keyword">state</span>, <span class="keyword">event</span>, <span class="keyword">action</span>, 
<span class="keyword">transition</span>.  A sixth keyword, <span class="keyword">returns</span>, was shown in the example
in its use as an informational element for actions, but is not further discussed here.  Identifiers follow the C rules, 
as do declarations, which may 
be comma seperated, as in the state and event declarations above, or set 
seperately delimited by semi-colons as are all of the action declarations.  
State and event declarations may be interspersed, but all must come before 
the first action declaration.  Naming scope is within a given machine; that 
is, on the one hand, all states and events must be declared within a 
machine in order to be used by the machine, and on the other, different 
machines may use the same names for states and events because they will 
apply only within that machine definition.
</p>

<p>
The action declaration is :
</p>

	<p class="inset"><span class="keyword">action</span> action_identifier[event_vector,state_vector];</p>

<p>
Or,
</p>

	<p class="inset"><span class="keyword">action</span> action_identifier[event_vector,state_vector] <span class="keyword">transition</span> state_identifier;</p>

<p>
Where event_vector is 
</p>

	<p class="inset">event_identifier</p>

<p>
or,
</p>

	<p class="inset">(event_identifier_list)</p>

<p>
with event_identifier_list being
</p>

	<p class="inset">event_identifier</p>

<p>
or
</p>

	<p class="inset">event_identifier, event_identifier_list.</p>

<p>
The analogous definition holds for state_vectors.
</p>

<p>It is also possible to declare an actionless transition:
</p>

	<p class="inset"><span class="keyword">transition</span>[event_vector, state_vector] state_identifier;</p>

<h2>More examples</h2>

<p>
There are many files with the .fsm extension included in the 
distribution, most found under the <i>test</i> directory.  All illustrate valid constructions.
Moreover, the tests starting with <i>full_test</i> create executables with action functions supplied.  The effects of the use of
other keywords not discussed here can also be seen, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>designating a machine to use action functions which return a state instead of an event</li>
<li>giving a machine some data</li>
<li>designating header files to be included by the generated header (perhaps needed by the data given to the machine)</li>
<li>designating a function to call on every machine transition</li>
<li>transitioning via functions that return states (with machines where actions return events).</li>
<li>assigning values from external enums to the internal event enumerations (this should be used only when forcing the generation
of switch statements for state handlers).</li>
</ul>

<p>Also found in the examples is some new functionality involving complex events.  The html side of this works, but a full test has not
yet been created.  This may be of interest to <i>ThreadX</i> fans, since the idea of the complex event comes from a working system
running under <i>ThreadX</i> where some events are messages taken from a queue, and can themselves contain enumerations which further
refine the event.  For example a message to control a subsystem might contain an enumeration indicating whether to activate
or deactivate the system.  In this way, the actual real events can be tracked in FSMLang (<i>subsystem.activate</i> being an event distinct
from <i>subsystem.deactivate</i>).
</p>

<p>Finally, the test makefiles show how to add
.fsm targets to a makefile.
